Thanks a bunch for purchasing Better Gizmos!

This package contains the following:
- BetterGizmos.cs, a static class you can call from any script to easily draw nice and handy gizmos
- A detailed example scene with an example script to show and explain every feature included in the BetterGizmos.cs script

Remember that all the BetterGizmos functions are meant to be used within OnDrawGizmos or OnDrawGizmosSelected.
If one or multiple BetterGizmos functions are called outside of a UNITY_EDITOR define, you may get errors while trying to build.

And... that's pretty much it! Nothing really hard to understand.

If you have any issue or suggestion, feel free to contact me at robin_blanc@hotmail.fr or to leave a comment on the asset's page in the Unity's Asset Store.

Happy developing!
